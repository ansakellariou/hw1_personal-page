              <h2><small><b>Welcome!</b><br></h2>
                      <h3>I am Antonia, a fourth year Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of
                          Thessaly and I expect to graduate in 2021.
                          I always wanted to learn and University has offered me the means to accomplish that.<br><br>
                          Growing up I realised that I wanted to combine Programming and Biology, my two passions.
                          Along the way, I have discovered that I also like Computer Architecture, Concurrent Programming,
                          and Networks all this through the classes that I have taken.<br><br>

                          Parallel to my studies since Summer of 2018, I had been working to Circuits and Systems Lab UTH.
                          I started with a summer internship and continued after the Summer as a full member of the laboratory.
                          There I developed and implemented an algorithm on General Petri Net to MSFSMs Transformation.<br></small></h3>
